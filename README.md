How to Activate and Run the Flask Application
Prerequisites
Ensure Python is Installed: Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system. You can check this by running:

bash
Copy code
python --version
Virtual Environment: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for your Flask project. If you don’t have a virtual environment set up, follow these steps to create and activate one.

Setting Up the Virtual Environment
Navigate to Project Directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/project
Create a Virtual Environment: Run the following command to create a virtual environment (replace venv with your desired environment name):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Once activated, your terminal prompt should show the name of the virtual environment.

Installing Dependencies
Install Required Packages: Ensure you have a requirements.txt file in your project directory that lists all necessary packages. Install these dependencies by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Flask Application
Run the Application: With the virtual environment activated and dependencies installed, run the Flask application using:

bash
Copy code
python run.py
Access the Application: Once the server starts, you should see output indicating that the Flask application is running. By default, it runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open this URL in your web browser to access your application.

Stopping the Server
Stop the Server: To stop the Flask server, go back to your terminal and press Ctrl+C.
